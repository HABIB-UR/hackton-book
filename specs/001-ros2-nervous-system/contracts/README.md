# Contracts: ROS 2 Nervous System for Humanoid Robots

This directory contains API contracts for any interactive components of the educational book. Since this is primarily a documentation project, contracts are minimal but may include:

- Endpoints for interactive ROS 2 examples (if any backend services are needed)
- Interfaces for any simulation components
- Data exchange formats for code examples

Currently, the project is a static documentation site with no backend API requirements.
