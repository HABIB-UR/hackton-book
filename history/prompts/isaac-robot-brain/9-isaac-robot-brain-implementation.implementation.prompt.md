## Prompt

```

```

## Response snapshot

Successfully implemented the AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™) documentation module with comprehensive content covering Isaac Sim, Isaac ROS, and Nav2 Navigation for humanoid robotics.

Completed implementation tasks:
- Created docs/module-3 directory structure
- Developed comprehensive documentation for Isaac Sim (photorealistic simulation and synthetic data generation)
- Developed comprehensive documentation for Isaac ROS (hardware-accelerated perception, VSLAM, sensor pipelines)
- Developed comprehensive documentation for Nav2 Navigation (path planning and bipedal movement logic)
- Created integration guide explaining how all Isaac components work together
- Created glossary of Isaac terminology
- Created style guide for Isaac documentation
- Updated Docusaurus sidebar configuration to include Module 3
- Added proper metadata and frontmatter to all documentation files
- Updated quickstart guide to reference the new Isaac content

All documentation follows professional publishing standards with technical accuracy, clear explanations for robotics students, and comprehensive coverage of NVIDIA Isaac technologies for humanoid robotics applications.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Complete Isaac robotics documentation module implemented
- 🧪 Tests: No tests needed as this is documentation content
- 📁 Files: Created 6 documentation files and updated sidebar configuration
- 🔁 Next prompts: Documentation is ready for review and deployment
- 🧠 Reflection: Implementation successfully completed all planned tasks

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Original
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Review documentation with target audience
