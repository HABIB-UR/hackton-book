# Unity Interaction Model Quiz

Test your understanding of Unity interaction models for high-fidelity rendering and human-robot interaction workflows.

## Questions

### 1. What does PBR stand for in Unity rendering?
- A) Physical-Based Rendering
- B) Physically-Based Rendering
- C) Physics-Based Representation
- D) Photorealistic-Based Rendering

**Correct Answer:** B) Physically-Based Rendering

**Explanation:** PBR stands for Physically-Based Rendering, which simulates how light interacts with surfaces based on physical properties.

### 2. Which Unity lighting type simulates sunlight or other distant light sources?
- A) Point Light
- B) Spot Light
- C) Directional Light
- D) Area Light

**Correct Answer:** C) Directional Light

**Explanation:** Directional lights simulate sunlight or other distant light sources that emit parallel rays.

### 3. What are the three main components of PBR materials in Unity?
- A) Color, Brightness, Contrast
- B) Albedo, Metallic, Smoothness
- C) Diffuse, Specular, Normal
- D) Red, Green, Blue

**Correct Answer:** B) Albedo, Metallic, Smoothness

**Explanation:** PBR materials in Unity are defined by Albedo (base color), Metallic (how metallic the surface appears), and Smoothness (how smooth or rough the surface is).

### 4. Which post-processing effect simulates light bleeding from bright areas in Unity?
- A) Depth of Field
- B) Motion Blur
- C) Bloom
- D) Color Grading

**Correct Answer:** C) Bloom

**Explanation:** Bloom simulates light bleeding from bright areas, creating a glow effect around bright objects.

### 5. What is the primary purpose of the ROS# bridge in Unity?
- A) To improve rendering performance
- B) To enable communication between Unity and ROS systems
- C) To add physics simulation
- D) To create 3D models

**Correct Answer:** B) To enable communication between Unity and ROS systems

**Explanation:** The ROS# bridge enables communication between Unity and ROS (Robot Operating System) systems, allowing exchange of data and messages.

### 6. Which Unity camera type automatically follows a target object?
- A) Static Camera
- B) Orbital Camera
- C) Follow Camera
- D) Panoramic Camera

**Correct Answer:** C) Follow Camera

**Explanation:** Follow cameras automatically track and follow a target object as it moves through the environment.

### 7. What does the acronym HRI stand for in robotics?
- A) Human-Robot Interaction
- B) Hardware-Rendering Interface
- C) Human-Reality Integration
- D) Hardware-Reality Interaction

**Correct Answer:** A) Human-Robot Interaction

**Explanation:** HRI stands for Human-Robot Interaction, which defines how humans can interact with robots in various environments.

### 8. Which sensor type is NOT typically simulated in Unity for robotics applications?
- A) RGB Camera
- B) LiDAR
- C) IMU
- D) Olfactory (Smell)

**Correct Answer:** D) Olfactory (Smell)

**Explanation:** While Unity can simulate visual, depth, LiDAR, and IMU sensors, olfactory (smell) sensors are not typically simulated in Unity for robotics applications.

### 9. In Unity, what is the purpose of collision avoidance for cameras?
- A) To prevent cameras from rendering objects
- B) To prevent cameras from passing through objects
- C) To improve rendering performance
- D) To add visual effects

**Correct Answer:** B) To prevent cameras from passing through objects

**Explanation:** Collision avoidance for cameras prevents them from passing through objects in the environment, providing a more realistic viewing experience.

### 10. Which Unity component is commonly used for handling user input in robot control interfaces?
- A) Rigidbody
- B) Collider
- C) Input System
- D) Animator

**Correct Answer:** C) Input System

**Explanation:** The Input System component in Unity is commonly used for handling user input from various devices (keyboard, mouse, gamepad) for robot control interfaces.

## Summary

This quiz covered fundamental concepts in Unity interaction models, including rendering techniques, lighting systems, PBR materials, post-processing effects, Unity-ROS integration, camera systems, and human-robot interaction principles. Understanding these concepts is essential for creating high-fidelity simulation environments for humanoid robots.
