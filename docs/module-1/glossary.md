# Glossary: ROS 2 Terms

This glossary provides definitions for key ROS 2 concepts and terminology used throughout the ROS 2 Nervous System educational material.

## A

**Action**: A communication pattern in ROS 2 for long-running tasks that provides feedback and the ability to cancel goals in progress.

## D

**DDS (Data Distribution Service)**: The middleware standard that ROS 2 is built on, providing the underlying communication infrastructure.

**Distributed Control**: An approach to robot control where different functions are handled by separate, communicating components rather than a single central controller.

## J

**Joint**: In URDF, a connection between two links that specifies the degrees of freedom of motion between them.

## L

**Link**: In URDF, a rigid body that represents a part of the robot (e.g., arm, base, sensor mount).

## N

**Node**: An executable that uses ROS 2 to communicate with other nodes; the basic unit of a ROS 2 system.

## P

**Package**: A modular unit of software in ROS that contains nodes, libraries, and other resources.

**Publisher**: A node that sends messages to a topic in the publish-subscribe communication pattern.

## S

**Service**: A synchronous request-response communication pattern in ROS 2.

**Subscriber**: A node that receives messages from a topic in the publish-subscribe communication pattern.

## T

**Topic**: A named channel for passing messages between nodes in the publish-subscribe pattern.

## U

**URDF (Unified Robot Description Format)**: An XML format for representing robot models, including links, joints, and visual properties.

## W

**Workspace**: A directory where ROS 2 packages are built and organized.
