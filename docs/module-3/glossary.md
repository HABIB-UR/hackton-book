# Isaac Glossary

This glossary defines key terms used throughout the NVIDIA Isaac documentation for humanoid robotics.

## A

**Autonomous Navigation** - The ability of a robot to move through an environment without human intervention, using sensors and algorithms to perceive the environment and plan paths.

## B

**Balance Control** - Systems and algorithms that maintain a humanoid robot's stability during movement and in response to external disturbances.

**Bipedal Locomotion** - The act of walking on two legs, specifically referring to humanoid robot walking patterns and control systems.

## C

**Capture Point** - A point on the ground where a humanoid robot should place its foot to stop its motion and maintain balance.

## D

**Domain Randomization** - A technique in simulation where various parameters (lighting, textures, physics) are randomized to improve the transfer of learned behaviors from simulation to reality.

## F

**Footstep Planning** - The process of determining where and when each foot should be placed during humanoid robot locomotion to maintain stability and achieve desired motion.

## G

**Global Planner** - A navigation component that computes the overall path from start to goal, considering static obstacles and environmental constraints.

## H

**Hardware Acceleration** - The use of specialized hardware (like GPUs) to speed up computational tasks, particularly important for real-time perception in Isaac ROS.

## I

**Isaac ROS** - NVIDIA's collection of hardware-accelerated perception packages for ROS/ROS2, including VSLAM and sensor processing pipelines.

**Isaac Sim** - NVIDIA's simulation platform for robotics development, providing photorealistic environments and synthetic data generation capabilities.

## L

**Local Planner** - A navigation component that adjusts the robot's path in real-time to avoid dynamic obstacles while following the global plan.

## M

**Model Predictive Control (MPC)** - A control strategy that uses a model of the system to predict future behavior and optimize control actions over a finite time horizon.

## N

**Nav2** - The ROS 2 navigation stack adapted for humanoid robots, providing path planning and movement execution for bipedal locomotion.

## P

**Perception Pipeline** - A series of processing steps that transform raw sensor data into meaningful information about the environment.

## S

**Simulation-to-Reality Transfer** - The process of applying behaviors, models, or algorithms learned in simulation to real-world robots.

**Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM)** - The computational problem of constructing or updating a map of an unknown environment while simultaneously keeping track of an agent's location within it.

## V

**Visual SLAM (VSLAM)** - A form of SLAM that uses visual sensors (cameras) as the primary input for localization and mapping.

**VSLAM** - Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping, using camera imagery for robot localization and environment mapping.

## Z

**Zero Moment Point (ZMP)** - A point on the ground where the net moment of the ground reaction force is zero, used as a stability criterion for humanoid robots.
