# Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) for Autonomous Humanoids

This module covers the integration of vision, language, and action systems to create autonomous humanoid robots capable of responding to voice commands with appropriate physical actions guided by visual perception.

## Chapters

1. **Voice-to-Action** - Voice processing with Whisper API
2. **LLM Planning** - Cognitive planning with LLMs
3. **Vision-Manipulation** - Vision-guided manipulation
4. **Capstone Autonomous Humanoid** - Complete system integration
5. **VLA Pipeline Summary** - Integration summary across all chapters
6. **Glossary** - Key terms and definitions

## Learning Objectives

By completing this module, students will understand:
- How to process voice commands into actionable robot behaviors
